## 🔄 PS2EXE Support (Optional)
For those who prefer not to mess around with PowerShell scripts directly, you can convert this `.ps1` script into an **executable file** using [**PS2EXE**](https://github.com/MScholtes/PS2EXE).  
```bash
 ps2exe .\GamingServicesNuker.ps1 -outputFile GamingServicesNuker.exe -iconFile "F:\Dev\fix-xbox\avatar.ico" -requireAdmin -company "Aboda7m1999" -product "Xbox Repair Tool" -version "1.0.3" -description "A tool to fix Xbox-related components" -title "Xbox Repair Tool"
```
This creates a .exe version of the script for easy execution.

⚠️ Warning
This script removes essential Xbox components and reinstalls them. Use it carefully if you're troubleshooting Xbox-related services and want a clean reinstallation path. For typical gamers, uninstalling may break certain Xbox features temporarily.
